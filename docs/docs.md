For the **`docs`** folder, you can include a set of documents that cover both development (DEV) and testing (QA). Below are some suggestions for documents that would be important for your project:

### 1. **Requirements Document (Functional and Non-Functional Requirements)**
   - **File name**: `requirements.md` or `requirements.pdf`
   - **Content**:
     - **Functional Requirements**: Features that the app must have (e.g., user login, task addition/removal, etc.).
     - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Aspects such as performance, response time, compatibility with different devices, security, etc.

### 2. **Use Cases Document**
   - **File name**: `use-cases.md`
   - **Content**:
     - Description of each use case, detailing the actors (users), actions (e.g., login, task creation), and expected results.
     - Use case diagram, if applicable.

### 3. **Architecture Document (System Architecture)**
   - **File name**: `architecture.md`
   - **Content**:
     - Description of the system architecture.
     - Description of the folder structure and main components of the app (e.g., MVVM architecture).
     - **Architecture Diagram**: A visual diagram showing how Activities, Fragments, ViewModel, and database (Room) communicate.

### 4. **Test Plan**
   - **File name**: `test-plan.md`
   - **Content**:
     - Description of the test scope, including unit, integration, and UI tests.
     - Tools used: Espresso, JUnit, etc.
     - Approach for different types of tests: functional, non-functional, performance, etc.

### 5. **Test Cases**
   - **File name**: `test-cases.md`
   - **Content**:
     - Detailed list of test cases with the following information:
       - **Test name**: (e.g., Test login with valid credentials)
       - **Steps**: What actions should be performed (e.g., open the app, enter email, click login).
       - **Expected result**: What should happen if the test passes (e.g., user is redirected to the task list screen).
     - Tests should cover both UI and business logic.

### 6. **Wireframes and Mockups**
   - **File name**: `wireframes.pdf` or `mockups.pdf`
   - **Content**:
     - Visual sketches or mockups of the app’s main screens (e.g., login screen, task list screen).
     - This can be useful for both developers and testers to understand how the interface should be presented.

### 7. **API Documentation (if applicable)**
   - **File name**: `api-docs.md`
   - **Content**:
     - If the app interacts with an external or internal API, you can include the API documentation here.
     - Detail endpoints, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), parameters, and expected responses.

### 8. **Deployment Guide**
   - **File name**: `deployment.md`
   - **Content**:
     - Instructions on how to compile and run the app (APK or AAB build).
     - Details on how to publish the app on the Google Play Store (if applicable).
     - Instructions to set up the development environment in Android Studio.

### Summary of the `docs/` Folder Structure:

```
/docs/
├── requirements.md          # Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
├── use-cases.md             # Use Cases
├── architecture.md          # System Architecture
├── test-plan.md             # Test Plan
├── test-cases.md            # Test Cases
├── wireframes.pdf           # Wireframes and Mockups
├── api-docs.md              # API Documentation (if applicable)
└── deployment.md            # Deployment and Publishing Guide
```

### Other Considerations:
- **Format**: You can use **Markdown** (.md) for documents that will be easily edited and viewed directly on GitHub. For diagrams or images, you can use PDFs or images (.png, .jpg).
- **UML Diagrams**: For **architecture** or **use case** documents, it would be useful to include UML diagrams, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams.
