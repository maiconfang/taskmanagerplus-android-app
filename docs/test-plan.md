# TaskManagerPlus Android App - Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy and scope for testing the TaskManagerPlus Android App. The goal of the testing process is to ensure that the app functions as expected and meets all defined requirements.

## 2. Scope of Testing
The testing will cover the following key areas:
- Functional testing of all user actions (e.g., login, task management).
- UI testing to ensure proper layout and interactions.
- Data persistence testing to ensure that tasks are saved and retrieved correctly.
- Error handling to verify that appropriate error messages are shown in case of invalid actions.

## 3. Testing Types

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Test individual methods and classes in isolation.
- **Scope**: 
  - Validation methods (e.g., login validation).
  - Task management methods (e.g., create, edit, delete tasks).
- **Tools**: JUnit, Mockito.

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Test how different components of the app interact with each other (e.g., ViewModel, Repository, Room database).
- **Scope**:
  - Interaction between ViewModel and Room database.
  - Task data flow from UI to database and back.
- **Tools**: JUnit, Room, Espresso (for some integration tests involving UI).

### 3.3 UI Testing
- **Objective**: Test the user interface to ensure that all UI components behave as expected.
- **Scope**:
  - Login screen functionality (input validation, button clicks).
  - Task list screen (adding, editing, deleting tasks).
  - Proper display of tasks (layout, scrolling).
- **Tools**: Espresso, UI Automator.

### 3.4 Functional Testing
- **Objective**: Test that the app's features work according to the requirements.
- **Scope**:
  - User authentication (login).
  - Task management (create, edit, delete, filter tasks).
  - Data persistence (saving tasks to the Room database).
- **Tools**: Manual testing and Espresso for automated functional tests.

### 3.5 Non-Functional Testing
- **Objective**: Test aspects like performance, security, and usability.
- **Scope**:
  - **Performance**: Ensure that the task list loads within 2 seconds.
  - **Security**: Verify that user credentials are encrypted and not exposed in logs.
  - **Usability**: Ensure that the app is easy to navigate and error messages are clear.
- **Tools**: Android Profiler for performance testing, manual security checks.

## 4. Test Environment
### 4.1 Devices
The app will be tested on the following devices:
- **Physical Devices**: 
  - Android phone (version 10.0, Pixel 3).
  - Android phone (version 8.1, Samsung Galaxy S8).
- **Emulators**: 
  - Android 11.0 emulator.
  - Android 7.0 emulator (for compatibility testing).

### 4.2 Tools and Frameworks
- **Android Studio**: For development and testing environment.
- **JUnit**: For unit and integration tests.
- **Espresso**: For UI testing.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.

## 5. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 5.1 Entry Criteria
- The development of a feature is complete.
- Unit tests for the feature have been written and passed.
- The build is stable, and all dependencies are installed.

### 5.2 Exit Criteria
- All functional and non-functional requirements have been tested.
- No critical bugs remain unresolved.
- All automated tests have passed successfully.
- The app meets performance and security benchmarks.

## 6. Test Schedule
- **Unit Testing**: During feature development.
- **Integration Testing**: After feature implementation.
- **UI Testing**: After the main user flows are implemented.
- **Functional Testing**: Continuous testing during the development cycle.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Near the end of development, before deployment.

## 7. Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Delays in development could impact the testing timeline.
  - **Mitigation**: Continuous integration and early testing of features will reduce the risk.
- **Risk**: Device fragmentation could lead to untested issues on specific Android versions.
  - **Mitigation**: Test on a variety of emulators and physical devices covering different Android versions.

## 8. Reporting
- **Test Reports**: Automated test results will be captured in Android Studio's testing environment. 
- **Bug Reporting**: Bugs will be tracked using GitHub Issues, with severity and priority labels.
