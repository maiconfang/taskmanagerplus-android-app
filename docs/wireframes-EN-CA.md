### Structure of the **`wireframes.pdf` or `mockups.pdf`** Document:

This document will be visual and contain the **mockups** or **wireframes** of the main screens of the app. Here are some screens you can include:

---

### 1. **Login Screen Wireframe**
   - Elements:
     - Email input field.
     - Password input field.
     - "Login" button.
     - (Optional) "Forgot Password" link (wonâ€™t be implemented for now).

### 2. **Task List Screen Wireframe**
   - Elements:
     - Task list with title and description.
     - "Add Task" button (usually a **Floating Action Button** in Android).

### 4. **Task Filter Options Wireframe**
   - Elements:
     - Task filter options:
       - **All tasks**.

       - **Pending tasks**.

### How to Create:
- You can use tools like **Figma**, **Sketch**, **Balsamiq**, or even draw by hand and scan the wireframes to create this document.
- The final file can be saved as **`wireframes.pdf`** or **`mockups.pdf`**, depending on the tool you use.

### Tip:
- Keeping the wireframes simple helps visualize the basic structure of the screens. During development, you can add more design details.
- These mockups will also be useful for the QA team to understand how the interface should work.
